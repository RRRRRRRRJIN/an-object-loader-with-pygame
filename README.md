**Design**
After reading the requirements, I designed three classes. Class polygedron is used for holding the information for the whole shape. Class vertex is used for holding the information for each vertex in the polygedron. Class face is used for holding the information for each face in the polygedron.

**Part one**

Part one can be divided into Four task:
    1. Read file 
    2. Store the information
    3. Draw the shape
    4. Draw the shape based on mouse movements



**How to Run**
Open the command shell on windows and change directory to the project file. Run ```py objectLoader.py```. A window will come out to show the result. After press any point on screen and drag the mouse, the polygedron will spin base on the mouse movement.
